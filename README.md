# authored-streamlits

Collection of streamlits written by zyBook authors.


## Structure

Each book has a separate folder. Ex: Data Science Foundations book has folder DataScienceFoundations.

Each file in each book folder is a streamlit app, like: DataScienceFoundations/example.py (TODO: update this example)

## st-cache discussion

TODO later. Add note of CPU vs memory trade-off and that we should profile against author streamlits (previous profiling was against random apps found online)
